## üêõ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: CORS Error
**Fix**: Make sure CORS_ORIGIN in Render matches your Vercel URL exactly

### Issue: API Calls Failing
**Fix**: Check REACT_APP_API_URL in Vercel environment variables

### Issue: Backend Sleeping (30-60s first load)
**Normal**: Free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity. First request wakes it up.

### Issue: Build Failed
**Fix**: Check build logs in Vercel/Render dashboard for specific errors
